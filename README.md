A mod for Nuclear Option to allow for managing permabans of users.

Currently runs on Unity Mod Manager but will most likely get a BepinEx entrypoint soon.

# Compiling
You need Nuclear Option installed and you need to edit your csproj accordingly. This was mostly an internal development so atm it is not very version control friendly having to edit the csproj.
You will also have to have UMM correctly installed into Nuclear Option to both compile and run the mod.

I am publishing this for collaboration by others in the community.
